ðŸŒ¸ Iris Flower Classification â€“ Machine Learning Project
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a complete machine learning pipeline applied to the Iris dataset, one of the most well-known and beginner-friendly datasets in the field of data science. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify iris flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

based on four key physical features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Python 3

Scikit-learn â€“ for model building and evaluation

Pandas â€“ for data manipulation

Matplotlib â€“ for data visualization

Jupyter Notebook â€“ for an interactive development environment

ðŸ“Š Workflow
Data Loading â€“ using sklearn.datasets.load_iris()

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) â€“ understanding feature distributions and relationships

Data Preprocessing â€“ splitting into training and testing sets

Model Training â€“ using a Random Forest Classifier

Model Evaluation â€“ using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Data Visualization â€“ scatter plots to explore feature importance and class separation

âœ… Results
The trained model achieved ~96% accuracy on the test data.

The highest separability was observed in petal length and petal width features.

Visualizations clearly show clustering patterns that support model performance.

ðŸ“š What I Learned
Fundamentals of supervised classification

How machine learning models learn from feature patterns

Importance of exploratory analysis before training

How to interpret model evaluation metrics

How to visualize multi-class classification problems

ðŸ§  Why This Project?
I chose the Iris dataset because it's an excellent starting point to learn the end-to-end ML pipeline in a simple, intuitive, and visual way. Though simple, it reinforces key concepts that apply to more complex real-world problems like:

Disease classification

Fraud detection

Sentiment analysis

Recommendation systems
