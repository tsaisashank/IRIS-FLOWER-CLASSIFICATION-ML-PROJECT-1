This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a machine learning model that classifies iris flowers into one of three species — Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica — using four key physical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The Iris dataset is one of the most famous datasets in data science and serves as a great introduction to supervised classification problems.

In this project, I built a complete ML pipeline using Python and Scikit-learn, covering data exploration, visualization, model training, evaluation, and result interpretation. A Random Forest Classifier was used due to its simplicity and high accuracy on small datasets. The final model achieved around 96% accuracy, showing clear separation between the classes, especially when using petal-related features.

I chose this project because it provides a solid foundation for understanding core machine learning concepts in a simple yet effective way. While the problem might seem basic, it reflects the same principles used in real-world applications such as medical diagnosis, image recognition, and fraud detection. It’s an ideal starting point for anyone looking to step into the world of AI and data science.

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook with the full implementation, including code, comments, and visualizations. Whether you're a student, a curious learner, or someone brushing up on ML basics, this project offers a clear and hands-on example of how machine learning works in action.
